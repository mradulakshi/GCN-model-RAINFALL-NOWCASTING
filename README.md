üåßÔ∏è Rainfall Nowcasting using GCN  
Welcome to the Rainfall Nowcasting using GCN project! This repository contains the implementation of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model designed to predict short-term rainfall by leveraging spatial and temporal dependencies in weather data. The project aims to enhance the accuracy of nowcasting, providing vital insights for meteorology and disaster management.  

üåü Project Overview  

Objective  
The primary objective of this project is to develop a GCN model that can accurately predict rainfall intensity in the near future. This is achieved by training the model on spatially distributed weather data, capturing both the temporal dynamics and the spatial relationships between different geographical locations.  

Why GCN?  
1. Spatial Relationships in Weather Data  
Geographical Connections: Rainfall patterns are not isolated events; they are often influenced by weather conditions in neighboring regions. For instance, rainfall in one location might be affected by wind patterns, humidity, or temperature in adjacent areas. GCNs excel at modeling these spatial dependencies by representing the data as a graph where nodes correspond to different locations (e.g., weather stations) and edges represent the relationships (e.g., geographical proximity or meteorological influence) between them.
2. Handling Irregular Data Structures  
Non-Euclidean Data: Traditional neural networks like CNNs are well-suited for grid-like, Euclidean data (e.g., images). However, weather data, especially when considering multiple locations, often doesn‚Äôt fit into such regular structures. GCNs can operate on graphs, which are more flexible and can naturally represent irregular structures, allowing for more accurate modeling of spatial dependencies in weather data.
3. Efficiency in Leveraging Spatial Data  
Sparse Data Representation: Weather stations or sensors are often sparsely distributed over a region. GCNs are efficient in processing sparse graphs, making them ideal for scenarios where data is collected from a limited number of locations but still requires an understanding of the broader spatial context.  
4. Combining Spatial and Temporal Dynamics  
Temporal Extensions: While GCNs are primarily designed for spatial data, they can be combined with other models like LSTMs or GRUs to capture temporal dynamics as well. This hybrid approach allows the model to understand how weather conditions evolve over time and how these changes are influenced by spatial relationships, leading to more accurate nowcasting.
5. Proven Effectiveness in Similar Domains  
Success in Spatiotemporal Tasks: GCNs have been successfully applied in various spatiotemporal tasks, such as traffic forecasting, air quality prediction, and social network analysis. Their ability to model complex relationships in such tasks suggests they are well-suited for the challenges of rainfall nowcasting.  
6. Enhanced Prediction Accuracy  
Learning from Spatial Patterns: By explicitly modeling the spatial dependencies, GCNs can often achieve better prediction accuracy compared to models that do not account for these relationships. This is particularly important in weather forecasting, where the accurate prediction of localized phenomena like rainfall depends on understanding the broader spatial context.
